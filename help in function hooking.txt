i work in a software testing company. And we test programs backward and forward compatibility.
Can you write a c++ code that spoof the windows build number
for example i am using windows 10 22H2 bulid 19045
i want to test if "setup.exe" if will work on windows 10 1507 build 10240

note setup.exe use the win32 API RtlGetVersion

and it is very important that the code that you MUST give me must fit inside single "main.cpp" file and NO other cpp files or libraries

And the code MUST NOT depend on any external library

and these are very important role that you must follow when writing the c++ answer for me
1- the hooked version of the win32 api function the function must be named for example "win32_api_function_Hook"
2- the orignal function must be named for example "win32_api_function_Original"
3- if you use type alias function must be named for example "win32_api_function_t"


please fix this c++ code. what header file to add to c++ code
